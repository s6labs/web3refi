### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Appeals

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal by contacting us at conduct@s6labs.com with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be reviewed by a different team member than the one who made the original decision.
